        <h2>About me</h2>
        <P>Hi, I’m Izumi  a Computer Science student with a passion for programming and new technology. I'm currently exploring the world of programming .

Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of anime especially romance genres . Shows like Your Name really inspire me with their storytelling and emotions. They remind me that even in the fast-paced digital world, there's always room for connection and heart.

I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and finding ways to be a little better every day. 

</P>
